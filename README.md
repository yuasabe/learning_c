# learning_c
Since I dont have much experience with C, I decided now is the time to get started. I'll be regularly updating this repo with the concepts I learned, and hopefully I'll be able to log a lot of it in the wiki too.
Some of the resources I'll be following:
- https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-variables-constants
- https://www.cprogramming.com/
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm

After I get the basics with the above tutorials, I'll move onto looking for more resources.
